# Rock or Mine prediction using Sonar data
## Overview

This project aims to predict whether underwater objects are rocks or mines based on sonar data. The dataset used for training and testing the model contains features extracted from sonar signals, making it a classification problem.

## Key Features

- Utilizes machine learning techniques (logistic regression) to analyze sonar data and make predictions.
- Python-based implementation for ease of understanding and modifiability.
- Includes data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation steps.
- Demonstrates the application of classification algorithms for real-world scenarios.

## Dataset

The project uses the [Sonar dataset] , which consists of sonar signals reflected from underwater objects. The dataset is split into training and testing sets to evaluate the model's performance.

Models Implemented

The project explores the effectiveness of various machine learning models, including:
Logistic Regression

Results
The accuracy of the model on the test dataset is: 90.4%
